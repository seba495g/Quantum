❗**HIGH DEMAND NEEDED FOR THE PROJECT TO BE FULLY DONE**❗<br />
Under this text, you can **get started** learn **how to program** in Quantum, and download the source. <br />
click [here](https://seba495g.github.io/Quantum-Web/download.html) to download the source <br />
Quantum is made with JavaScript and TypeScript <br />
Quantum originaly would've been a tool for Chromebooks <br />
if you need/want the background logo of C/C++, you can download it in the **Packages** section <br />

# Update log
 • added a course

   **How to program**<br />
     • you have your coding space at quantum's compiler, <br />
     • start by typing *&gitport quaio.qh* which <br />
     • makes coding possible, think like <stdio.h>. <br />
     • qua:out >> text, will print out the text after the '>' <br />
     • qua:in >> text, it will create a input with the text after the '>' <br />
     • webopen >> text, it will open a new tab with the url after the '>', remember https:// <br />
     • if statement, this is how it works, `if variable == value then run code` <br />
     • variable, this is how it works, `int variable = value` or `int variable = q:in >> text` <br />
     or go to [Quantum Course](https://seba495g.github.io/Quantum-Web/course.html)
   
   **How to setup**<br />
     • you dont need a JavaScript compiler or anything<br />
     • you can just use [Quantum compiler](https://seba495g.github.io/Quantum-Web/compiler.html)<br />
   
  **How to use**<br />
     • Go to the official website, go to <br />
     • compiler, and code there<br />
